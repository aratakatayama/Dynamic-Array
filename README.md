# Dynamic-Array
## Implementation of a Dynamic Array 
In a high level programming language there are two types of arrays: static and dynamic arrays. Static arrays can not change it's size once the data for the array is allocated. Thus if we know how much space we are going to use for a certain program, static array might be a better solution. Dynamic array, on the other hand, allows the array size to change according to how many data is needed. Often times, dynamic array is an illusion of being dynamic, and the underlying structure is made of combined static. This is the documentation of dynamic array using static arrays.
